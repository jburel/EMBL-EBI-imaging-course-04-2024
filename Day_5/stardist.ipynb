    "This original image was converted into the Zarr format. The analysis results produced by the authors of the paper were converted into labels and linked to the Zarr file which was placed into a public S3 repository.\n",

    "In this notebook, the Zarr file is then loaded together with the labels from the S3 storage and analyzed using [StarDist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist). The StarDist analysis produces a segmentation, which is then viewed side-by-side with the original segmentations produced by the authors of the paper obtained via the loaded labels.\n",
